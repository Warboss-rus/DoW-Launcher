# DoW-Launcher
10 year old project written in Embercadero RAD Studio (Delphi)
- Can launch any mod without ingame Mod Manager.
- Command line parameters (skip intro, developer mode, and other custom parameters).
- Automatic mod combination (strongly recommended to only use on race mod since combining total conversions will lead to unexpected results)
- Support and automatic detection of all Dawn of War and steam Dawn of War 2 titles (Dawn of War2 must be installed to a root Steam folder)
- Module file editing (DoW1 only)
- Creating shortcuts for mod launching without a launcher.
- Configuring some Local.ini options (DoW1 only)
- Support for Russian and English languages (including automatic detection upon first launch)
